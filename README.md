# Dataset:
# Name: Mental Health data
# Description: a dataset with 19 features with a binary 'depression' column which we can use as a predictor in our experiments for the report

# Folder Structure
train.csv - labelled dataset we can use to train ML models against and 
test.csv - dataset we can use to assess the ability of the model
test.py - python file for performing investigatory work
test.R - R script where we can use the 

# Project Structure
1. Loading in data - Completed
2. Cleaning up data - dealing with null values, dealing with outlies, etc...
3. Exploratory data analysis - investigate relationships and trends in the data that might help us in out goal of binary classification 
4. Data pre-processing - one-hot-encoding for cateogrorical fields, normalising data, etc...
5. Training - building ML model and create a pipeline for training it on data
6. Results - pick best metric and discuss the results that we get from testing the model against test dataset

# Notes
T - I was thinking that because R is a bit of a weird language we could initially use python to develop a bit of a prototype for doing some of the invesitgatory work, and then once we have a solid grasp of it, convert it over to R code 


# TODO:
1. split up different sections (cleaning and exploring data, data preprocessing and feature engineering, using ML models to perform binary classification on dataset)
